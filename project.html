                    Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828 in the town of Varanasi. She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu. Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother was Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai); they hailed from modern-day Maharashtra. At four years old her mother passed away. Her father was the Commander of War under Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithorr District. Rani Laxmi Bai was educated at home, able to read and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, and fencing which was in contrast to the cultural expectations for women in Indian society at the time.</div>

        <u><h2 style="text-align : center;"> MAHATMA GANDHI</h2></u>
        Monhandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the small town of Porbandar, on the west coast of India, on October 2 1869. He belonged by birth to the Vaishya, or trading caste. His father died when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother became the greatest influence in his life. Her spiritual teacher was a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central doctrine is the "sanctity of all life," or Ahimsa, which is often translated as "non-violence." This teaching remained paramount with Gandhi.
